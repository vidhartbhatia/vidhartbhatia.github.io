# My Personal Website

![Demo](files/Demo.gif)

I wanted to build a basic website with some links and information but at the same time I wanted to make something cool so I decided to make it a fun doodle space.

I love having a blank canvas in front of me and then going crazy with it so I made this to share my joy with the world!

It also let me work with canvas, javascript events, object oriented design and some fun math.
Enjoy!
