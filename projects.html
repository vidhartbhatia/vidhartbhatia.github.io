          <h1>BOBS Ramen</h1> 
          <p> College students are always hungry, lazy and sometimes busy. So four hungry overworked freshman decided to do something about it! and from our combined intellect and stomach gurgles BOBS ramen was born!
            BOBS Ramen is an internet connected automated ramen cooker. Through an iOS appication one can choose a spice level and a time and come home to a freshley prepared steaming hot cup of Ramen!
            <br>
            BOBS was built in 24 hours with a NodeMCU board, lots of cardboard, and only the best quality Ramen. It also managed to win the Mentors choice award at HackCMU 2016!

          <h1><a id="git" href= "http://ecollectmumbai.com/">E-Collect</a></h1>
          <p> A couple of years ago I discovered that electronic waste was a rapidly growing problem in India so I started e-collect with the aim to make recycling  e-waste simple. I built a website on the WordPress platform
            and set up a form that people could fill in online. Over the first year I slowly progressed from my neighbourhood to the entire south Mumbai area, and have now collected over a ton of electronic waste.
             Through the use of flyers, newsletters, and presentations at schools and colleges, I have tried to inform as many people about e-waste as I can. I also tied up with an NGO to ensure that all the e-waste I collect is efficiently broken down and recycled.
           <br>

          <p> Full disclosure Rittu Bhatia is my Mother so this is mostly a shameless plug. GO CHECK HER OUT!.<br>
            I set up her website using WordPress with a modified theme and gallery plugin. I also designed the layout and helped pick the featured images (which are amazing).<br>
